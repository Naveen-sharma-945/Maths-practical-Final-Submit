### 🧾 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to **solve matrix-related problems** using **NumPy** in Python.  
It includes examples such as:

- Finding **determinant** of a matrix  
- Checking **singular/non-singular** property  
- Finding **inverse** of a matrix  
- Computing **eigenvalues and eigenvectors**  
- Performing **matrix multiplication, addition, and transpose**

###INDEX
   1. Create and transform vectors and matrices (the transpose vector (matrix), conjugate transpose of a vector (matrix)).

2. Generate the matrix into echelon form and find its rank.

3. Find cofactors, determinant, adjoint and inverse of a matrix.

4. Solve a system of homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations using Gauss elimination method.

5. Solve a system of homogeneous equations using the Gauss Jordan method.

6. Generate basis of column space, null space, row space and left null space of a matrix space.

7. Check the linear dependence of vectors. Generate a linear combination of given vectors of Rⁿ / matrices of the same size and find the transition matrix of given matrix space.

8. Find the orthonormal basis of a given vector space using the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process.

9. Check the diagonalizable property of matrices and find the corresponding eigenvalue and verify the Cayley–Hamilton theorem.

10. **Application of Linear Algebra:** Coding and decoding of messages using nonsingular matrices.
    Example: code “Linear Algebra is fun” and then decode it.

11. Compute Gradient of a scalar field.

12. Compute Divergence of a vector field.

13. Compute Curl of a vector field.
